Deep Learning Neural Nerwork based Synonym Filter
In this project we are going to develop a deep-learning based synonym filter.
This is different from traditional filter as traditional filter is implemented using a dictionary.

Brief idea - Here we won't have a dictionary. We are going to directly search from Wordnet (a lexical database of semantic relations between words) and train our neural networks depending upon the synonyms we get from there.
